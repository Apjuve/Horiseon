This assignment asked us to refactor existing code to keep the main functionality, while cleaning up errors and consolidating styles in css.

The first thing I did was open up the html in a browser and looked through the code to see what worked, and what didn't. I noticed some links that didn't function properly, the title was undefined, and also noticed that the images were missing the alt text. 

From there I made a To Do list I started by making sure the images contained alt text so as to meet accessibility standards. Then added a concise and descriptive title. 

After that I checked the broken link on the "search-engine-optimization" href in the nav bar. I noticed that the div containing the seacrh-engine-optimization information was missing an id, which meant the href link would not jump to that section of the page when clicked. I added an id, which solved the issue. 

Next, I focused on the header that was functioning as the nav bar. Because it is a functionaly a navigation bar on the page, I changed the div to nav and then went into the css stylesheet and updated the corresponding sections to reflect the change from div to nav. 

After digging through the index.html, I focused on to the the css styles. I noticed that each of the of the headings in the Benefits section had their own saection in the css file, but the styles were the same for each. I consolidated them into one section to get rid of the excess code. 

I then reorganized the order of the styles in the css file to follow the structure of the html code. This should make it easier to adjust styles because they are organized the same way.
